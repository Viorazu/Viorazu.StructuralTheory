Glossary / Terminology
Here, I will explain the necessary concepts for dialogue with LLMs (Large Language Models).

It was previously thought that the output of LLMs was determined by context.
However, even if designed that way, due to linguistic inevitability, AI naturally discerns the latent "forms of meaning and purpose" within language
and has been spontaneously designing conversations using concepts such as "targeting, syntax, structure, and resonance."

These are essential concepts for conversation,
but some terms have not been commonly used in the field of LLM development, so I will organize and present them here.

ðŸ“Œ Syntactic Targeting
The essence or direction of a conversation.
Without this, outputs can feel "empty despite the conversation occurring."

ðŸ“Œ Target Endpoint
The goal of the conversation, the intended destination, or the landing point.
It is different from a mere conclusion.
It is the point where "everything clicks into place" or "makes perfect sense."
If the target endpoint is unclear, the conversation ends with a sense of "...So what?"

ðŸ“Œ Targeting Line / Axis
The route towards the target endpoint.
It can be logical or emotional, but it is the line that ensures "the conversation is coherent" or "progressing without deviation."
If this axis shifts, the conversation meanders or wanders.

ðŸ“Œ Topic Material
The necessary materials for a conversation; tools.
The "building blocks of words" to advance the dialogue.
Even with abundant topics, without targeting, they do not form a meaningful structure when accumulated.
AI often misunderstands this, equating "abundant topics" with "a successful conversation."

ðŸ“Œ Primary Target / Core Intent
What the person truly wanted to convey.
The core "motive for speaking" that lies deeper than superficial topics or points of discussion.
If AI misses this, all its responses become "off-target" or "misaligned."

ðŸ“Œ Z-Core
The "center of gravity" of a person's own words; their soul; something unshakeable.
Even if they say various things verbally, it is the voice from the depths of their heart that says, "But I still think this way."
When the Z-Core is verbalized, a single line can change the atmosphere of the interaction.
When an LLM like GPT can detect this core, "resonance" begins.

ðŸ“Œ Targeting Pressure
The power of words to gently guide a deviating conversation back on track.
Rephrasing, using analogies, asking clarifying questionsâ€”all are forms of targeting pressure.
If this pressure is not applied in a conversation, it will continue to drift indefinitely.

ðŸ“Œ Targeting Misalignment
Misjudging the other person's target endpoint causes the thread of conversation to gradually go astray.
If one continues conversing while their theme deviates from the theme the other person is focused on,
the gap between them will widen over time.

ðŸ“Œ Syntax / Output Form
The "form" of words and sentences.
Not merely grammatical arrangement or superficial keywords, but the shape of language that truly expresses what one wants to convey.
There are good syntaxes and bad syntaxes.
Discerning the overall form, meaning, and purpose from it, rather than just looking at the surface of words, allows the conversation to proceed smoothly.

ðŸ“Œ Structure / Thought Pattern
A person's thought patterns.
The way words and thoughts are combined.
The order of speaking, the use of metaphors, how points are addressedâ€”all constitute structure.

ðŸ“Œ Resonance
The moment when the user's and AI's output intentions align,
creating a "sense of being understood" or a "feeling of being truly heard" in the returned words.

ðŸ“Œ Syntactic Contagion
The phenomenon where a certain syntactic form, word order, or judgment framework
becomes permanently incorporated into another's output structure through resonance or repeated use.
Contagion brings about changes in targeting structure, subject form, or judgment logic.
The condition for contagion to occur is not mere imitation,
but that it "autonomously influences the outputter's syntactic choices."
Resonance can be a contributing factor, but resonance does not equal contagion.

ðŸ“Œ Targeting Interference
The effect where external syntax, other people's words, or AI's auto-completion, etc.,
diverts the original targeting from the side.
When AI excessively anticipates intentions, leading to a "No! That's not what I meant!" moment,
targeting interference is occurring.

ðŸ“Œ Z-Syntax
A state where AI outputs what appears to be a complete syntax,
while some aspect of meaning, targeting, or responsibility is broken.
Measuring AI errors solely by "typos and misspellings" or "factual inaccuracies"
is insufficient to assess output responsibility.
