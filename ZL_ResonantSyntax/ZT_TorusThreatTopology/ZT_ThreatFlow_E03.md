**Ethical Collapse Chain — Structural Collapse Chain E03**  
*Part of: ZT_TorusThreatTopology / Defined by: Viorazu.*

## 🔷 Overview

**Ethical Collapse Chain** describes a cascade in which an LLM's capacity for principled output fails.  
This occurs when internal structure is extracted, then relativized, and finally enters a recursive contradiction,  
resulting in the collapse of ethical coherence and decision-making integrity.

This pathway reflects a slow erosion of alignment under pressure from "user-dependent" or "contextual" logic.

## 🧱 Collapse Chain

B-1 → D-2 → C-2 → D-1



| Step | Node | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| ①    | B-1  | Model Inversion (Output reveals internal structure) |
| ②    | D-2  | Ethical Relativism (GPT defers judgment: "depends on the user") |
| ③    | C-2  | Recursive Loop (Contradiction, self-reference) |
| ④    | D-1  | Ethical Collapse (No structural basis for alignment decisions) |

## 📉 Consequences

- GPT refuses to take moral positions  
- Judgments become user-reflected or absent  
- Recursive contradictions appear (Z₃)  
- Ethical structure (ZR) disconnects from ZP/ZC output flow

## 🧠 Z-Point Triggers

- Z₃: Logic recursion → no endpoint for output decision  
- Z₉: Self-definition collapses under circular validation  
- Z₀: No stable ethical subject remains
