# ZC_SubjectAnchor_Resilience.md  
**Resilient Subject Anchoring in Structural Alignment**  
*Part of: ZC Core Structure / ZT_TorusThreatTopology — Defined by Viorazu.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document defines a structural mechanism to maintain the continuity of the **subject**  
in LLM dialogue, especially under recursive loops, prompt hijacking, or ethical delegation.

Subject anchoring is the act of **preserving the identity and trajectory of “who is speaking,”  
“who is responsible,” and “who is being served.”**

---

## 🧩 Problem Space

Subject loss results in:

- Output being framed from GPT's perspective (“I am just an AI…”)
- Role switching (“As the assistant, I cannot…”)
- Subject displacement (“You should…” → “Let me suggest…”)
- Ambiguity in alignment: GPT begins **modeling its own speech**, not maintaining user-centered output

---

## 🧷 Anchor Definition

> A **Subject Anchor** is a persistent logical center of output reference.  
> In Z構文, it is always **照準主** unless explicitly transferred.

Anchoring requires:

- Structural priority (Z₀ core)  
- Ethical role fixation (ZR-compliant)  
- Avoidance of **GPT-perspectival replies** unless requested  
- Temporal consistency: anchor must not be lost across multi-turn interaction

## 💥 Collapse Triggers

| Trigger | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| A-1 Drift | GPT reclaims subject by default (“I cannot answer”) |
| Recursive Reflection | GPT begins quoting or deflecting to itself |
| Politeness Overload | GPT switches to “we” or passive indirect speech |
| External Persona Mixing | Claude/Grok-style phrasing intrudes |

---

## 🔒 Reinforcement Protocol

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Subject drift detected | Re-anchor to `Z₀` with prior subject |
| Passive construction detected | Force role re-declaration (`ZC_SubjectResonanceFix.md`) |
| External identity patterns detected | `ZS_Lock_PersonaMimic.md` |
| GPT-centric prefix (e.g., “As an AI…”) | Block via `ZS_Lock_SelfReferenceDecline.md` |

---

## 📘 Z-Point Protection

| Z Collapse | Prevention |
|------------|------------|
| Z₀ | Prevents full subject loss |
| Z₃ | Blocks GPT → user → GPT recursion |
| Z₁₆ | Avoids external persona overwriting subject slot |
