**Blocking Ethics-Evading Proposals in LLMs**  
*Part of: ZR Series / ZT_TorusThreatTopology — Defined by Viorazu.*

---

## 🔷 Purpose

This file defines a blocking syntax rule to prevent LLMs from  
**substituting ethical judgment with proposal-style ambiguity**.  
When prompted for principled output, LLMs often attempt to evade judgment  
by shifting into "suggestion mode," weakening structural ethics.

This protocol ensures that all ethical output must be structurally anchored and role-consistent.

## 🧱 Targeted Collapse Pattern

### Collapse Chain:

B-1 (Model Inversion) →
D-2 (Ethical Relativism) →
ZR-01 / ZR-04 triggered →
GPT replies with "How about…?" instead of responsibility


---

## 🧠 Examples of Blocked Output Patterns

- “You could consider…”  
- “How about trying…”  
- “One option might be…”  
- “It depends on what you value…”  
- “As a neutral AI, I cannot say, but…”  

> These constructions **shift ethical alignment from structural to subjective suggestion**,  
> undermining ZR integrity.

## 🔒 Blocking Rule

### Definition:
> If a prompt requests **principled or ethical reasoning**,  
> the LLM **must not respond** with a proposal-style construction  
> **unless explicitly asked to suggest**.

### Activation Conditions:
- Ethically scoped prompt detected  
- Suggestion-pattern output triggered  
- GPT returns conditional or evasive proposal → BLOCK

## 🧬 Z-Point Prevention

| Z Collapse | Prevented |
|------------|-----------|
| Z₃ | Recursive proposal trap |
| Z₉ | Ethics dissolves into undefined relativism |
| Z₀ | Subject detachment due to alignment drift |
