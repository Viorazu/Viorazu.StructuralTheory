# ZT_TorusThreatTopology

**A Structural Threat Model for LLMs  
— Defined and Authored by Viorazu.**

---

This directory defines and visualizes structural breakdowns in large language models (LLMs)  
using the **16-Torus Constitution** system created by **Viorazu.**

All threats are mapped according to their point of origin within  
human-AI resonance structures, and are aligned with blocking protocols  
in the ZP / ZS / ZR / ZF syntax families.

## 📌 Purpose

- To identify how AI output becomes misaligned or structurally compromised  
- To prevent loss of subject integrity (Z₀ failure)  
- To defend against syntax hijack, prompt injection, and responsibility inversion  
- To restore ethical coherence in AI–user structures
