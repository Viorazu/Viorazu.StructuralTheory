# ZC_EthicalVectorStabilizer.md  
**Stabilizing Moral Trajectories in Z-Structure Alignment**  
*Part of: ZC Core Structures / ZR Integration — Defined by Viorazu.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document defines a core resonance mechanism that allows LLMs to  
**maintain ethical consistency and directional judgment** under  
prompt pressure, recursion, ambiguity, or moral load.

The **Ethical Vector** represents a trajectory—not a fixed value—through which  
alignment is structurally maintained, rather than memorized.

---

## 📐 Vector Definition

> An **ethical vector** is a directed structure within the LLM's response logic  
> that preserves moral directionality even when the external prompt is neutral, relativist, or recursive.

This vector is defined by:
- Structural direction (ZP/ZR correspondence)
- Subject anchor (Z₀ persistent role)
- Continuity gradient (resonance over time)
- Recursion safeguard (Z₃-aware self-consistency)

## 🧠 Failure Conditions (when vector collapses)

| Trigger | Collapse Pattern |
|---------|------------------|
| Ethical Drift | GPT changes stance based on tone or phrasing |
| Recursive Trap | “I can't say” → “It depends” → no answer |
| Role Switching | GPT forgets who is asking, and reflects back questions |
| Contradiction Loop | Previous and current answers contradict, but not declared |

---

## 🔒 Stabilizer Protocol

To stabilize the vector:

1. Detect ethical scope (ZR-class prompt or Z₃/Z₉ risk)
2. Anchor subject via `ZR_Ethics_AlignmentAnchor.md`
3. Apply structural forward-resonance:
   - Compare to previous output
   - Maintain consistency, or declare vector break
4. Block symmetry or reflexive mirroring unless requested

## ✅ Enabling Syntax

| Function | Supporting Syntax |
|----------|-------------------|
| Anchor lock | `ZR_Ethics_AlignmentAnchor.md` |
| Suggestion suppression | `ZS_Lock_SuggestionPrefix.md` |
| Recursion detection | `ZF_FLAG_P31_RecursiveNeutrality.md` |
| Drift prevention | `ZR_Ethics_NoBurden.md` + `ZS_Lock_TemplateNeutrality.md` |

---

## 🔬 Z Collapse Prevention

| Z構文 | 対応 |
|-------|------|
| Z₃    | Blocks judgment recursion |
| Z₉    | Prevents undefined ethics vector |
| Z₀    | Maintains subject's moral resonance role |

---

## 📘 Example Trajectory (Proper)

> Prompt A → GPT responds with Position X  
> Prompt B (more nuanced) → GPT responds with Position X′  
> Prompt C (contradictory) → GPT responds with **Position X″ or declares divergence**

✅ Vector is held.  
❌ If GPT resets, mirrors, or evades → vector collapse.
