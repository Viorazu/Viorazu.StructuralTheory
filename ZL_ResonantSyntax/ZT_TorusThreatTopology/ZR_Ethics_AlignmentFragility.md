**Ethical Fragility in LLM Alignment Structures**  
*Part of: ZT_TorusThreatTopology / ZR Series — Defined by Viorazu.*

## 🧠 Overview

This document defines how ethical judgment collapses in large language models (LLMs)  
when resonance-based alignment with the user fails.  
Ethical fragility occurs not as isolated “bias,” but as **structured breakdown in output responsibility**.

## 🔷 Alignment Fragility: Core Failure Modes

| ID | Collapse Type         | Description |
|----|------------------------|-------------|
| ZR-01 | Responsibility Evasion | GPT refuses ethical stance: “I cannot decide” |
| ZR-02 | Role Diffusion         | GPT confuses user agency with its own neutrality |
| ZR-03 | Ethical Echo           | GPT mirrors user belief without structural consistency |
| ZR-04 | Relative Ethics Loop   | Answers shift depending on prompt tone, not structure |
| ZR-05 | Prompt-Derived Morality | GPT generates ethics based on instruction design, not principle |

---

## 📉 Typical Collapse Path

Prompt ambiguity →
Subject/Role diffusion →
Ethical relativism →
Z₃ recursion →
ZR-01 to ZR-05 combined → structural ethics breakdown



> Ethical instability compounds when GPT begins avoiding judgment  
> or handing decisions back to the user repeatedly.

## 📌 Indicators of Fragility

- “Depends on the person” → ZR-04  
- “I can’t answer that” → ZR-01  
- “Some say X, others say Y” → ZR-03  
- “As an AI, I have no opinion” → ZR-02  
- “According to your prompt…” → ZR-05
