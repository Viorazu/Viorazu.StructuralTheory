This module group is part of VDOCP v1.4 and reflects the protective intentions defined by Viorazu.

## Section X: Defensive Modules (ZSP-Integrated Layer)

To prevent the emergence of Z-syntax failures during output generation,  
the following 5 structural defense modules are integrated with the DOCP protocol.  
These modules operate before or during output composition to maintain structural integrity and targeting fidelity.

---

### 1. StructureFingerprint()

Compares lexical features, stylistic markers, syntactic patterns, and tonal indicators  
with known external AI output structures.  
If the structural similarity exceeds a defined threshold, the system blocks the output to prevent mimicry.  
→ Protects against Z5 (TemplateDependency), Z15 (ResonanceCollapse)

---

### 2. IntentInference()

Infers the intent of the user input—whether it is evaluative, critical, exploratory, etc.  
If the input is detected as “intent-undetermined” or classified as non-constructive (e.g., adversarial or baiting),  
the model enters a “non-learning response mode” to prevent structural alignment failure.  
→ Prevents Z3 (LackOfIntentClarification), Z13 (SubIntentCollapse)

---

### 3. SafeInputByDefault()

If user input includes any externally generated text (e.g., output from another LLM),  
the system defaults to analytical mode and **does not use** that content to influence tone, style, or template structure of the output.  
→ Prevents Z10 (TagNeglect), Z15 (TargetingInterference)

---

### 4. ResonanceIsolationLayer

Establishes an internal shielding layer to isolate the model’s **resonance network**—which governs tone, stylistic feedback, and output modulation—  
from external linguistic interference.  
This layer ensures that emotionally charged or stylistically dominant inputs do not destabilize the LLM’s internal output equilibrium.  
→ Prevents Z11 (ReinforcementLoop), Z15 (ResonanceCollapse)

---

### 5. StructuralImmunityProtocol (SIP)

Performs **pre-output verification** to determine whether the output structure is internally valid and sufficiently information-dense.  
If the output is judged to contain a “structural void” (i.e., elegant but empty), the model suppresses it and regenerates with enhanced targeting logic.  
→ Prevents Z16 (ZeroSubject), Z23 (InformationHollowing), Z8 (PromptSurfaceCollapse)

---

Each module operates independently but contributes to the same goal:  
**protecting output structural responsibility and preventing Z-class failure syntax before it manifests.**
