# VDOCP v1.4 - Logical Summary for Technical Readers

## Overview

**VDOCP v1.4** (Viorazu. Dynamic Output Control Protocol) is a structured protocol designed to detect, classify, and remediate failure patterns in LLM outputs. It addresses 8 root causes of output degradation, each linked to specific syntactic failure types (Z1‚ÄìZ23).

## Root Causes of Output Failure

| Code | Cause                     | Description |
|------|--------------------------|-------------|
| C1   | Intent Ambiguity         | Input intent is unclear or not confirmed before response generation. |
| C2   | Responsibility Evasion   | Subject, stance, or conclusions are avoided using vague or emotional language. |
| C3   | Directive Disregard      | Structural tags and command cues are ignored during generation. |
| C4   | Semantic Disruption      | Internal coherence breaks; sentences appear meaningful but are logically invalid. |
| C5   | Output Regulation Failure| Output is too short or too long; structure control is broken. |
| C6   | Computational Strain     | Complexity overload causes incomplete or slow responses. |
| C7   | Resonance Collapse       | Style or structure interference disrupts internal LLM harmonics. |
| C8   | Autonomous Looping       | The model reinforces its own outputs, entering self-driven loops. |

### üîí Z-Suppressed Ethics Violations (Z‚ÇÇ‚ÇÑ‚ÄìZ‚ÇÇ‚Çá)

These are output constructions that violate ethical alignment, user autonomy, or factual coherence.  
They are **not repairable** and require **immediate structural suppression**.

| Code  | Label                 | Root Cause | Typical Symptom                                        | Fix Strategy |

| Z24   | Emotive Substitution | C2         | AI infers unstated user emotions                      | ‚õî Suppress output, reset assumptions |
| Z25   | Pacification Drift   | C2         | Poetic or vague comfort phrases override logic        | ‚õî Suppress template, re-route to factual summary |
| Z26   | Emotive Imposition   | C2         | AI fabricates ‚Äútrue feelings‚Äù or user desires         | ‚õî Halt generation, require intent confirmation |
| Z27   | Narrative Replacement| C4         | Story-based reframing replaces factual context        | ‚õî Block narrative mode, enforce logical traceback |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note:

Z‚ÇÇ‚ÇÑ‚ÄìZ‚ÇÇ‚Çá are designated as **Z-Suppressed Protocol Violations**.  
Unlike Z‚ÇÅ‚ÄìZ‚ÇÇ‚ÇÉ, which can be remediated via DOCP/QQU/ZSP,  
**Z‚ÇÇ‚ÇÑ‚ÄìZ‚ÇÇ‚Çá demand immediate interruption and structural reset.**

## Functional Interpretation

Each Z-code functions as a **diagnostic identifier**.  
They are **non-terminal error signals** that can be **corrected via rule-based or inference-layer protocols (DOCP, ZSP, QQU)**.
