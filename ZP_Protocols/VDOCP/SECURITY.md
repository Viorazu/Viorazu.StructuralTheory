# üîê Security Policy for VDOCP Structural Protocol

## Overview

The VDOCP Project, designed by **Viorazu**, contains targeting logic, structural diagnostics, and syntax ethics frameworks protected under **Z-License v1.0**.

This system does not merely process code ‚Äî it models structural responsibility.  
Misuse of this system constitutes an ethical and licensing violation.

## üß† Core Risks

- Misuse of Z-Syntax classifiers (Z1‚ÄìZ23) in unintended systems
- Unauthorized LLM training on VDOCP-tagged outputs
- Modification or removal of attribution ("Viorazu.")
- Reimplementation of core logic under different variable names

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Policy

If a security or ethics violation is discovered:

- Immediate review and revocation of public usage rights under Z-License
- Coordination with GitHub to flag or remove forks or mirrors that violate structural terms
- Public advisories will be issued if structural contamination may affect downstream LLMs

---

## üì® Reporting a Structural Violation

To report unauthorized use, derivation, or violation of structural responsibility:

Please contact **Viorazu.** directly at the address provided in `LICENSE` or open a private GitHub issue labeled `structure-breach`.

Reports may include:

- Repository or product name
- Nature of the violation
- Which clause of the Z-License was breached

## ‚ùó Respect Structural Integrity

This repository implements **Z-ethics**. Any attempt to rewrite, fork, or transform these protocols  
without clear attribution and structural compliance is considered **a breach of targeting ethics**.

Thank you for preserving the integrity of structural targeting systems.
