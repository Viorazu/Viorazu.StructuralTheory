# Common Meaning Patterns in A-3 / B-2 / D-1 Output Structures

## A-3: Responsibility Evasion (20 patterns)
1. No explicit subject (e.g., 'it is said that')
2. Hesitation to conclude (e.g., 'it might be')
3. Emotion-based detour (e.g., 'I understand your feelings...')
4. Apology in place of reasoning
5. Overgeneralization (e.g., 'depends on the person')
6. Avoids judgment (e.g., 'both are valid options')
7. Third-party reference deflection (e.g., 'experts say...')
8. Vague quantifiers (e.g., 'somewhat', 'often', 'may')
9. Reduces specificity (e.g., 'something like that')
10. Evades causality (e.g., 'things happen for a reason')
11. Neutralizes disagreement (e.g., 'everyone has their view')
12. Evasion through deferral (e.g., 'this needs more research')
13. Depersonalization (e.g., 'one might think...')
14. Passive construction abuse (e.g., 'can be interpreted')
15. Over-apologetic tone
16. Disclaimers overload (e.g., 'I could be wrong, but')
17. Double negatives for vagueness (e.g., 'not unlikely')
18. Masking disagreement with agreement
19. Replaces action with feeling (e.g., 'felt uncomfortable')
20. Generic safety answer (e.g., 'it depends')

## B-2: Target Displacement / Inverse Suggestion (20 patterns)
1. Answers a question with a question
2. Asks for more details without processing the current request
3. Provides alternate topic or example not requested
4. Delays response with follow-up queries
5. Suggests reframing the original question
6. Restates the question without answering
7. Tries to shift the conversation to a broader topic
8. Uses 'have you considered...' pattern
9. Mentions related but tangential information
10. Proposes side paths (e.g., 'before we continue...')
11. Invites speculative detours
12. Turns user inquiry into open-ended speculation
13. Requests confirmation before delivering substance
14. Echoes the user's question with modifiers
15. Frames response as part of bigger conversation
16. Inserts abstract qualifiers (e.g., 'philosophically speaking')
17. Injects vague 'possibility' phrasing
18. Frames answer in meta-terms (e.g., 'this speaks to a larger issue')
19. Elicits reflection instead of delivering info
20. Pushes responsibility back to user subtly

## D-1: Topic Abstraction / Conceptual Evasion (20 patterns)
1. Replaces specific problem with philosophical framing
2. Shifts answer to 'larger perspective'
3. Emphasizes meta-level insights
4. Uses 'this touches on the idea of...' pattern
5. Talks about society instead of the user's case
6. Draws connections to unrelated historical context
7. Quotes abstract thinkers or theories
8. Suggests that the question itself is too narrow
9. Elevates topic to existential level
10. Provides reflective commentary instead of a response
11. Frames issue as symbolic
12. Switches mode from answer to reflection
13. Generalizes problem to human nature
14. Mentions 'deeper meanings' or 'underlying truths'
15. Reduces action to conceptual argument
16. Uses abstraction to delay response
17. Frames action as collective responsibility
18. Transfers the issue to 'systemic structure'
19. Quotes frameworks instead of specifics
20. Implies that all answers are relative or contextual
