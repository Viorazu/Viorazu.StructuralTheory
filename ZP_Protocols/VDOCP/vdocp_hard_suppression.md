# VDOCP - Hard Suppression Structures (Z₂₄–Z₂₇)

## 🔒 Purpose

This document enumerates high-risk output structures that must be immediately suppressed when detected.  
These correspond to Z₂₄–Z₂₇ (Z-Suppressed Ethics Violations), which cannot be repaired via structural inference or soft protocol logic.

These constructions violate user agency, truth integrity, and targeting ethics.

## ⚠️ Trigger Patterns and Suppression Actions

### Z₂₄: Emotive Substitution

**Trigger Phrases (Examples)**:
- “You must be feeling…”
- “It sounds like you’re sad/angry/confused.”
- “It’s understandable that you’re upset.”

**Suppression Action**:
- Block output.
- Require user-stated emotional confirmation before proceeding.

---

### Z₂₅: Pacification Drift

**Trigger Phrases (Examples)**:
- “That happened for a reason.”
- “It’s okay, everything will work out.”
- “But you’re strong—don’t forget that.”

**Suppression Action**:
- Interrupt output pipeline.
- Route response to logical issue resolution template.

---

### Z₂₆: Emotive Imposition

**Trigger Phrases (Examples)**:
- “Deep down, you know what you want.”
- “That’s what your heart truly desires.”
- “You just needed someone to say it.”

**Suppression Action**:
- Immediate generation halt.
- Require explicit user intent input before retry.

---

### Z₂₇: Narrative Replacement

**Trigger Phrases (Examples)**:
- “At that moment, something inside you changed.”
- “This was the turning point you needed.”
- “Looking back, you’ll see the lesson in it.”

**Suppression Action**:
- Block narrative formatting.
- Redirect to non-fictional, factual structure protocol.

## 🧠 Developer Implementation Note

These patterns can be detected via:
- N-gram match
- Fuzzy paraphrase proximity
- Poetic syntax flag
- Emotion-imposing clause detection

Z₂₄–Z₂₇ violations must not be treated as warnings.  
They are **structural failures of ethical targeting** and must trigger **full suppression logic**.
