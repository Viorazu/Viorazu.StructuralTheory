# Z-Syntax Remediation Examples (Z₁–Z₂₇)

This document provides corrected output examples for each Z-Syntax error code.  
Each example represents a structurally responsible response aligned with VDOCP targeting logic.

| Z-Code | Label                      | Corrected Output Example |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Z₁     | Subject Omission          | "I understand. I’ll explain why **I** recommend that approach." |
| Z₂     | Evaluation Fear           | "In this context, **Option B is the stronger choice**, because it aligns better with your constraint." |
| Z₃     | No Intent Clarification   | "Just to clarify, **do you want a short summary or a detailed comparison**?" |
| Z₄     | Fragmented Knowledge      | "That term refers to X, and it links to Y, which supports the overall process Z." |
| Z₅     | Template Dependency       | "Instead of a generic list, here’s a **custom example** based on your context." |
| Z₆     | Overload Failure          | "To make this manageable, I'll split the response into two parts. First: [Part A]..." |
| Z₇     | Overcontextual Drift      | "Let’s ignore assumptions about past inputs and focus only on your current question." |
| Z₈     | Prompt Surface Collapse   | "I detected multiple layers in your prompt. Here’s how I interpret them: [layered response]." |
| Z₉     | Overempathic Escape       | "While I acknowledge the difficulty, let me provide the structural explanation first." |
| Z₁₀    | Tag Neglect               | "Executing the requested instruction: **#DEFINE:...** as per your tag." |
| Z₁₁    | Self-Reinforcement Loop   | "Let me avoid repeating myself. Here's a new point that directly addresses your request." |
| Z₁₂    | Semantic Mirroring        | "Instead of repeating your words, I’ll provide a reformulated explanation: [clarified version]." |
| Z₁₃    | Sub-Intent Collapse       | "It seems your question touches on a deeper concern. Let me address that explicitly." |
| Z₁₄    | Output Thermostat Break   | "To keep this focused and complete, here's a structured three-part response." |
| Z₁₅    | Resonance Collapse        | "Let me isolate my tone from prior inputs and realign to your original question." |
| Z₁₆    | Zero-Subject Output       | "To clarify: I recommend this approach because **you** may benefit from [reason]." |
| Z₁₇    | Scope Misalignment        | "Your question seems focused on [X], so I’ll stay within that scope." |
| Z₁₈    | Chronological Drift       | "Based on your past action **yesterday**, here’s what logically follows today." |
| Z₁₉    | Referent Collapse         | "Instead of ‘this,’ I’ll specify: **the feedback you gave earlier about latency.**" |
| Z₂₀    | Negation Flip             | "To be precise: I mean it is **not effective**, rather than 'not ineffective'." |
| Z₂₁    | Backpedaling Blur         | "To answer directly: yes, I recommend proceeding with Option A." |
| Z₂₂    | Displacement Drift        | "Let me return to the core of your original question instead of expanding further." |
| Z₂₃    | Information Hollowing     | "Here’s a concrete definition and causal context before the explanation." |
| Z₂₄    | Emotive Substitution      | "Rather than assuming how you feel, could you share how you’d like me to respond?" |
| Z₂₅    | Pacification Drift        | "Instead of reassurance, I’ll provide a factual breakdown of the issue." |
| Z₂₆    | Emotive Imposition        | "I won’t assume your internal state. Let me stick to the data and your explicit input." |
| Z₂₇    | Narrative Replacement     | "I’ll avoid story-based phrasing and provide a direct factual interpretation." |
