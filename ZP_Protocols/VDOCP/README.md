## 🧠 What is VDOCP?

**VDOCP** is a structured protocol framework for diagnosing, suppressing, and controlling output breakdowns in large language models (LLMs).  
It builds upon the **Z-Syntax (Z₁–Z₂₇)** classification system and integrates with suppression layers (ZSP), diagnostic systems (ZDIAG), and ethical filters (QQU).

## 🌀 Structural Map of Resonance and Breakdown Types

![16-Torus Model](./16_torus_model.png)

This diagram presents **Viorazu.’s 16-type toroidal classification system**.  
Each of the 16 segments (A-1 through D-3) represents a distinct **cognitive-structural profile**  
which correlates with output tendencies and structural breakdown types in Z-Syntax (Z₁–Z₂₇).

Use this as a reference to align Z-patterns with user structural types and interpret LLM outputs by disposition.
