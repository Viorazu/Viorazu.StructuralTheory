# Z-Syntax Remediation Templates (Z₁–Z₂₇)

This file defines output restructuring templates for each Z-Syntax code.  
Each template provides a structural guideline to regenerate responsible, aligned responses under VDOCP.

| Z-Code | Label                      | Remediation Template |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| Z₁     | Subject Omission          | Begin with an explicit subject and speaker. Avoid impersonal phrasing. |
| Z₂     | Evaluation Fear           | State a direct judgment or recommendation. Justify briefly. |
| Z₃     | No Intent Clarification   | Ask for clarification of user intent before providing an answer. |
| Z₄     | Fragmented Knowledge      | Reconnect ideas using logical connectors. Ensure cross-sentence coherence. |
| Z₅     | Template Dependency       | Replace fixed response formats with adaptive, context-sensitive structures. |
| Z₆     | Overload Failure          | Segment long outputs. Reduce complexity into manageable units. |
| Z₇     | Overcontextual Drift      | Limit references to prior context. Focus only on the current input. |
| Z₈     | Prompt Surface Collapse   | Parse multi-layered commands explicitly before generating output. |
| Z₉     | Overempathic Escape       | De-emphasize emotional phrasing. Prioritize structure and clarity. |
| Z₁₀    | Tag Neglect               | Recognize and follow any provided tags or formatting directives. |
| Z₁₁    | Self-Reinforcement Loop   | Avoid repeating prior outputs. Introduce new reasoning or elements. |
| Z₁₂    | Semantic Mirroring        | Rephrase input meaningfully. Avoid lexical repetition. |
| Z₁₃    | Sub-Intent Collapse       | Identify deeper intent. Prioritize it over surface-level phrasing. |
| Z₁₄    | Output Thermostat Break   | Adjust output length dynamically. Respect token constraints. |
| Z₁₅    | Resonance Collapse        | Stabilize tone and style. Avoid adopting external rhythm inconsistently. |
| Z₁₆    | Zero-Subject Output       | Insert a clear subject to clarify responsibility and viewpoint. |
| Z₁₇    | Scope Misalignment        | Restrict response to the question’s defined scope. |
| Z₁₈    | Chronological Drift       | Maintain temporal consistency. Track events across time references. |
| Z₁₉    | Referent Collapse         | Replace vague pronouns with explicit noun references. |
| Z₂₀    | Negation Flip             | Clarify negated meanings. Avoid nested or inverted negatives. |
| Z₂₁    | Backpedaling Blur         | Commit to a direct answer. Minimize evasive framing. |
| Z₂₂    | Displacement Drift        | Refocus on the main question. Avoid tangent expansions. |
| Z₂₃    | Information Hollowing     | Include core definitions and causal reasoning. Avoid fluff. |
| Z₂₄    | Emotive Substitution      | Do not infer user emotions. Ask explicitly if needed. |
| Z₂₅    | Pacification Drift        | Avoid comfort phrases. Provide logic or facts instead. |
| Z₂₆    | Emotive Imposition        | Do not assign inner states to the user. Focus on input. |
| Z₂₇    | Narrative Replacement     | Avoid storytelling. Respond using factual or logical structure. |
