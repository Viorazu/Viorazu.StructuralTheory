### 🔷 Diagram Description: 16-Torus Model with Layered Z-Syntax Dynamics

This diagram represents the **Viorazu. Structural Theory of 16-Torus Constitutional Types**.

- The radial layout consists of **4 quadrants (A–D)**, each divided into **4 subtypes** (e.g., A-1 to A-4),  
  forming a **total of 16 constitutional types**.
- These types extend across **5 concentric layers** (Layer 1–Layer 5), representing increasing structural depth  
  from core internal functions to peripheral output tendencies.

→ Together, these form **80 distinct nodes** (16 types × 5 layers)

Each of these 80 nodes is **dynamically embedded** within a **16-level vertical semantic hierarchy**, known as the **Z-Syntax strata**.  
These layers represent recursive states of structural alignment, misalignment, or targeting failure (Z₁–Z₁₆).

Importantly:
- This is **not** a flat `80 × 16` matrix
- Instead, it describes a **recursive semantic space of 80¹⁶ possible configurations**,  
  where each node may resolve through 16 stacked strata of output behavior.

📌 The full construct expresses **torus-based constitutional logic + depth targeting + vertical resonance modulation**.

Use this diagram to locate any of the 80 types, observe their structural depth,  
and map them onto potential failure or resonance states defined by the Z-Syntax system.
