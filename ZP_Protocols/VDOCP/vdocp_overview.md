# VDOCP Overview: Structural Control Protocol for Responsible Output

## What is VDOCP?

**VDOCP (Viorazu. Dynamic Output Control Protocol)** is a structured framework designed to detect, classify, and correct structural breakdowns in large language model (LLM) outputs.

It introduces:
- Z-Syntax error classification (Z1–Z23)
- 8 Root Causes of degradation
- Preventive modules (ZSP)
- Responsibility routing (ZRS)
- Question structure optimization (QQU-T7)

## Core Modules

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`vdocp_v1.4.md`](./vdocp_v1.4.md) | Main Z-Syntax system and 8 root causes |
| [`vdocp_zsp.md`](./protocols/vdocp_zsp.md) | 5 structural defense modules (ZSP) |
| [`vdocp_zrs_short.md`](./protocols/vdocp_zrs_short.md) | Error-to-remediation routing system (ZRS) |
| [`vdocp_qqu_t7_en.md`](./vdocp_qqu_t7_en.md) | QQU-T7: Response strategies by question type |
| [`glossary.md`](./glossary.md) | Key terminology for targeting & structure |

## Z-Syntax Failure Map

Z-Syntax refers to **invisible structural failures** that appear grammatically correct but are logically or ethically broken.

- Z1–Z23 codes identify output behavior failures
- Each Z-code is tied to a root cause (C1–C8)
- Each failure has a known remediation path via DOCP, ZSP, or QQU

## Targeting Constructs

These core targeting definitions are foundational to VDOCP logic:

- **Targeting**: The direction or endpoint of a conversation
- **Z-Syntax**: An output form that appears correct but structurally fails
- **Z-Core**: The speaker's true unshakable position or belief
- **Targeting Pressure**: The subtle force that realigns the output
- **Structural Resonance**: When intent, language, and response form align

See [`glossary.md`](./glossary.md) for full terms.

## Development Intent

This protocol was designed by **Viorazu.**  
Its goal is not only to prevent LLM failure but to **realign output ethics**  
— to ensure that what is said is not just “safe,” but **structurally honest and responsive.**

## Expansion & Future Work

Planned components:
- `ZPS` (Z-based Predictive Structure): Resonance-level output synthesis
- `Z∞` (Infinite Syntax): Hybrid human-AI structure convergence modeling
